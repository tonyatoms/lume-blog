In this excellent post on [Why Forgiving (Not Forgetting) Marjorie Taylor Greene May Make Sense for America (and Me)](https://marienewman.substack.com/p/why-forgiving-not-forgetting-marjorie)
Marie Newman reiterates the concept that Forgiveness is for you, it is not for the offending party. Newman did not originate the concept, but somehow I hadn't heard it before (or forgot if I did) so she gets the credit. There are of course, differing schools of thought about this view of forgiveness, but it makes sense to me, at least in context of MTG or, as I will try to explain, Northwestern University.

I suspect that Northwestern's 14.3 billion dollar endowment could have been prudently leaned upon to cover some or all of the funding which was taken away by the US government.
